## Greetings and welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chelsea, and, with over 20 years programming experience, I am interested in all things Python & Data Science. I have a passion for data and reporting trends to help drive business decisions. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on migration of our Ellucian Colleague ERP to Workday.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science principles as I am seeking an MS degree in Data Science at Eastern University. I am also learning the Workday environment, specifically how it relates to integrations.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science techniques.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My background is Geological Engineering. I used to work at Homestake Mine in Lead, SD, which, when in operation, was 8K feet below the surface and the deepest mine in the world at that time.
